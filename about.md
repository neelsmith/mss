The data in [this project's github repository](https://github.com/openmss/mss) use [the CITE architecture](http://cite-architecture.github.io/) to relate citable images to data about manuscripts.  Basic information about each manuscript is organized in a CITE Collection of manuscripts;  each manuscript in turn is related to an ordered collection of individual pages, and pages are related to citable images.
